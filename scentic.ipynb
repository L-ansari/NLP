to both i say yes!! it is also profoundly ignorant to fail to acknowledge the simple fact that \"the law\" is an ever-evolving, ever-changing social construction. it is a fundamental misapprehension &amp; misunderstanding of law to presume our justice system serves to support victims of sexual assault... even loved ones raise questions about what the victim might have done to cause sexual assault or physical abuse. rt : not the relatives &amp; friends that don\\'t listen, it\\'s the authorities &amp; it\\'s disgusting. : that\\'s why women don\\'t speak up, especially with a celebrity involved. yes. same is true for child sex assault. rt : evil only prospers when good men,and women, do nothing every week in canada a woman dies from domestic abuse. if that woman is your child, sister, or mother would you listen to her?

am i wearing a judges robe? do i have a prison in my backyard? your remarks are foolish. rt : presumption of innocence implies nothing about the validity of an allegation or alleged victim. rt : we won\\'t even let women wear a hijab at a citizenship ceremony but we\\'ll convict on thi \"the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything about it.\" : i don\\'t know and neither do you. the difference is, i\\'m not making myself judge and jury. yes, you are. : can you send me the link?

criminal code (242): injury to, or death of, a child due to mother neglecting child birth aid, with intent to end life or to conceal birth. giesbrecht, , is charged with offences of \"concealing the body of a child\". yes. police confirm: dead babies. giesbrecht was originally arrested for homicides before her high-priced defence arrived. translation: giesbrecht was arrested for the homicide of babies; but her savvy lawyer successfully swayed the law. giesbrecht was first arrested for homicide but those charges were changed to offence of concealing bodies. it is *possible* all infants were taken to the storage by another person(s), but either way the charges hold her culpable. true. however, law enforcement has enough evidence to support the rare charge of child concealment; so, homicide is logical. o canada can y\\'all please explain to me why, we as a nation, systematically continue to deny from age -18? unconscionable. rt : because the police don\\'t know what happened yet to those babies let alone who they were born to. dead babies. no homicide charges. the woman who owned the winnipeg storage locker is charged with concealment?
